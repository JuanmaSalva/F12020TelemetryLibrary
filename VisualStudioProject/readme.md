#F1TS VisualStudio 2019 project

Yo can use this project as you wish.
All temporary files will automaticly go inside a bin file in the Solution directory,
but the default destination of the .dll .lib... will be the project directory. For a cleaner 
organization, change the output directory in the properties of the project to $(SolutionDir)Lib\$(Configuration)\$(Platform).
Everyting else should already be set. 

The only thing left is open the .sln and start to use it!
